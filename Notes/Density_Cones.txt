Display results as density cones.

Have different potential routes for a stock to go.
Take the upper and lower to some SD (this could be user configurable), which would create a 
"cone" of possibilities. You'd run this out until it diverges past a certain width (also,
user configurable). Then inside the cone, the color would be darker for prices led to by more
paths, and lighter for less likely outcomes.
You could also go to earlier prediction points to see how its density cone compared to its
actual outcome. You could sort this so you could look at better behaving or worse behaving
examples, or maybe more applicable or less applicable (ie evaluating how a declining market
will perform is probably more applicable to look at behaviors in past decling markets).

This output could also be accompanied by a summary sheet of stats about the density cone,
and how well it has fared in the past. You could even get graphs of how well it performed
versus time or versus price or versus derivative (or second derivative) of the price

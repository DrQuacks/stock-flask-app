I need to derive a bunch of features. I think all of these should be logs.

-trailing averages. Maybe every 10 days?

-raw value obviously
    -if trailing avgs were 1, 11, 21, etc... would that make more sense? Maybe, but not for 1. You
    already have that value stupid

-first derivative

-most recent min and max

-so many days week min and max (like 10 day min and max)
    -should be done with Low and High 

-both binary target column and target price column
    -next days price and whether next days price was higher or lower 


Start at day 90:
    calculate trailling avgs of 1,11,...91. Each goes into a new column.
    in each period, I should also be finding the min and max
        -this can be done within my compute avg function, like it can return lowest low and highest high
    keep track of most recent min and max and probably their dates too, though I may not use that
        -this is a variable that gets updated in my for loop when checked against current days low/high 
        -no additional looping needed
    use pct_change() to calc deriv column all at once 
    next day's price is target price 
    comparing next day's price gives binary target column

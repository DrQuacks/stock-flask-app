-normalize starting at certain date
    -this might be as simple as a vertical shift
    -maybe not...or at least it'd need a vertical stretch/shrink as well
    -or...is it a vertical stretch pinned at (0,0)?

-display table of raw values as an option

-calculate derivs from most recent max or min 

-need a way to make one stock "active"
    -tooltip and other things would ping off of it
    -I could store it in plotPrefs

-a way to select start and end with the tooltip
    activate a set start date and set end date thing, and it'd trigger on mouse up

-get max of maxes and min of mins
    -maybe like it has to be a bigger max than the last local max

-plot raw data and predicted data, and color the lines with a heat map depending on accuracy

-I should be plotting open and close
    -And then I should predict one from the previous.
    -ie. close predicts open, open predicts close. Having close predict close is moronic.

-Make bars to show days range based on high and low

-Make Prediction Bars toggle-able, for eith red or green or both

-I should make it easy to see on the graph where your train and test are

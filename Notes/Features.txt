-normalize starting at certain date
    -this might be as simple as a vertical shift
    -maybe not...or at least it'd need a vertical stretch/shrink as well
    -or...is it a vertical stretch pinned at (0,0)?

-value range selector
-display table of raw values as an option

-calculate derivs from most recent max or min 

-need a way to make one stock "active"
    -tooltip and other things would ping off of it
    -I could store it in plotPrefs

-a way to select start and end with the tooltip
    activate a set start date and set end date thing, and it'd trigger on mouse up

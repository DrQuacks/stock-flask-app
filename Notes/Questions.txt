How many days trailing average do stocks tend to fall before they rebound?
    -I should try to see if I can predict just based on the order of trailing averages used, as well
        as the raw price. That might be simple to run, if I make columns for each, and put a 1 in whatever
        state it's in. I could also try making it an ordinal thing, so like the highest average is a 6, and
        then the next highest is a 5, and so on. I could even try normalizing all of them...
        Maybe I wanna do both? I could do the binary columns thing (that'll get unwieldy for too many 
        averages). And then I can also do the normalization thing. I should try this for different spacings
        and different numbers of averages.

Is recent distances between max and min lines indicative of anything? Does greater space mean the market
is changing moods?
    -If I go with the plan above, I could test if this gives me a sense for when things are changing.

How do I quantify double peaks and double troughs?
